This directory contains the NITRO C++ bindings.

This code depends on 4 external dependencies, all from the open source CODAForge repository. These dependencies are:

- except : common exceptions
- str    : string utilities
- sys    : system utilities
- mt     : threading

The bindings obviously also require the NITRO C headers and library. For now, we do not have a driver that will automatically build it for you. Instead, we just include the c/nitf directory in the includes/libpath. In the future, we may provide a driver that builds the C library. Note that this means you should configure both the C and C++ libraries the same. For example, if you want a 64-bit build, make sure to pass the --enable-64bit flag to both configures.

Below is an example of how to build:

% cd trunk/c
% ./configure --enable-debugging
% make
% cd ../c++
% ./configure --enable-debugging
% make
