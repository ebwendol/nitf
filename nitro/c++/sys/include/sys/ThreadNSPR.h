 *  \class ThreadNSPR
 *  \brief The implementation for Netscape Portable Runtime threads
 *
 *  This class wraps the Netscape thread code.  It can be used with
 *  default constructors, making it a user-level thread.  It could
 *  also be called with a specialized derived class.  The custom
 *  functions here allow for some non-standard manipulation (for
 *  example, the number of CPU's).  Somebody put a lot of work into
 *  NSPR, and I didnt want to avoid some of the clever features,
 *  just because pthreads or Caspr dont support them
